DV,None of the above,,,,,Chem 12a lab has been great. Everything else is meh,
S,Receive DSP (Disabled Students' Program) accomodations,Transfer,Re-entry student,First generation,Student parent,"It’s beyond impossible to keep up with the course work and readings, let alone all the extra assignments my professors and gsi have decided to include this semester to “keep track of participation.” Every week I feel like I’m falling further behind not only in my own work but also in  keeping my child up to date on the extra homework he’s getting for kindergarten. ",family responsibilities
KC,Transfer,,,,,"As a junior transfer student, I was really hoping to fully experience Cal student life physically on campus. It makes me quite sad and disappointed to think that I will only spend my senior year at Cal after the arduous process of applying. So far, talking with faculty has made my transfer process a lot easier, but nothing beats actually being at Berkeley. COVID-19 just made this all a big missed opportunity for me.",
HP,First generation,,,,,"It has been rough! There’s been so much going on in my personal life (my grandpa passed, I was out of a job for a while), much more than if I was at Berkeley because the people around me don’t really take “being in school” as a priority or even anything significant. For example, my parents will just walk in during one of my live zooms and ask me to do something for them right then and there, disrupting my concentration and understand of what my professor said. I also have been working two jobs because I need more money during this pandemic, which I wouldn’t be doing either at Berkeley. And on top of all of this, I feel like professors are overcompensating for us being at home, like it elicits harder or more work. I’m not sure why they think like that but it just makes it even more stressful. But I mean I’m getting through! It’s just really hard to stay motivated. ",job loss/financial struggles
AL,None of the above,,,,,"I’m very fortunate in that my classes are interesting and more electives than usual, but being online has made it harder to concentrate. It feels like professors have resorted to using assignments to gauge attention and comprehension but many of these assignments feel overwhelming and more punitive than anything—it’s almost as if the point is not to learn but “just make it” to the next thing to turn in. One benefit has been that utilizing office hours and tutoring sessions is easier than before!",
JW,Transfer,Re-entry student,First generation,,,"To be quite honest, my experience with online learning has been terrible. I've regretted not differing enrollment every day of the semester. At the community college that I attended, I would spend countless hours every semester working with tutors, professors, and peer study groups in positive learning environments. This is simply not possible while studying online. There are some tutoring hours available. However, everytime that I have tried to take advantage of this resource the tutor has either been unable to answer my question, or some technical difficulty gets in the way of them helping. Instead of working together with others to gain a better understanding of the material, I find my self struggling for hours at times to finish one or two problems on a homework assignment. Technical issues have been a common theme throughout the semester. Everyday, at least one of my classes has connectivity issues, which interrupts the entire class and can be very distracting. Furthermore, trying to get a Professor to reply to an email has proven to take a fair bit of time. If I ask them a question via email, by the time they get back to me I have usually figured it out on my own. I don't blame the professors for this because I am sure that they are being bombarded with hundreds of emails daily. Overall, I feel that I am not getting the education that I should be. I am essentially teaching myself at this point and I am not a very good teacher. I am unsure at this point weather I will continue in the spring or not. With all of the stress, anxiety, depression, and sleepless nights, it hardly seems worth it to me.",
JBJ,Receive DSP (Disabled Students' Program) accomodations,Transfer,Re-entry student,First generation,Student parent,"Awful. I will say that if we weren’t doing online learning, I would not be able to attend this semester. I suffer a chronic condition that requires medication that lowers my immune system, making me a part of the vulnerable population. This medication is new- because when I moved here a few months ago- my condition significantly worsened and now they have to get it under control by suppressing my immune system. 

As a parent, it’s bad. Trying to teach myself and trying to keep both my daughters on track is a nightmare. There’s not enough time in the day. I’ve pretty much given up on trying to balance it all. 

As a first generation transfer student, it’s even more challenging. Imposter syndrome is real. I still have yet to feel comfortable speaking in any of my classes and this semester is almost over. This is something I feel I would have conquered had we been in person. 

I feel like some professors are really out of touch with the challenges that students are dealing with. 

Learning from home, means we are learning with distractions. Some students are still having to work paying jobs. I’ve seen some students sit through a lecture while at work with a bunch of distraction behind them and it’s heartbreaking. 

When I’m in lecture, it’s even more difficult, because my kids need my help, so I am taken away from lectures or sections to address the needs of my kids. 8 and 10 year olds really don’t know how to be self sufficient during these trying times, when it comes to education. 

BUT- even if their new school opens to a hybrid model- the best thing would be to send them to school, which is a double edged sword. That would be best for them, but if they come in contact with covid and bring it home to me, while I’m taking these medications, I’m at serious risk for not being able to fight it if I become infected. 

Due to the loud environment some students, like myself, experience while in lecture on zoom (relative to each student and their personal situation) I have to zoom in relatively close distance with kiddos, so I can address my girls if they need help. 

Given these circumstances, my environment is loud and distracting. It makes it hard to participate fully in class when it comes to unmuting and trying to speak. My grade in many classes is dependent upon participation. This is a problem. 

I don’t know why more professors don’t use the discussion feature on zoom for students to accumulate participation points. I think it would allow everyone the chance to participate. All a professor or GSI has to do is ask a question, ask for a reading response, or ask a series of questions, post it, let people respond in 100 words or less and BAM!! students are engaged, learning the material, and no one is robbed of participation. Great success! 

Zoom has many wonderful features that professors could be taking advantage of. Rhetoric-20 with Professor Mascuch is amazing, but he also has two really excellent GSI’s who have helped to make the class as effective as it is. This class gives me the least anxiety on how it is constructed. 

Between Professor Mascuch, Marcos, and Katie, they have really pinned down a successful and effective way of utilizing these advantages available on BCourses, and are making it far more effective for students during these times. 

They are constantly trouble shooting all the time to figure out the right mode for students and they are constantly implementing student surveys to check in with students and asking for course feedback. 

It’s imperative that professors become more in touch with the needs of students, but most importantly, while most professors have been extremely accommodating to students, it’s really hard for some of us, especially a first generation transfer student with major health issues who is also a parent of two daughters who are also distance learning, to find a groove that works.  

While this is my first semester here, I’ve heard from other students that professors this semester seem to have ramped up the reading and work load. If this is true, it is not conducive to a solid education at this time. It’s counter productive. A lot of what I have seen or experienced this semester has been counter productive. ESPECIALLY with these types of challenges, and in this moment. 

What’s worse, I think everyone is going through more than what they are willing to admit and no one wants to talk about it. Everyone is doing their best to stay positive and stick with the “we will get through this together” mentality. Which is great, but it prevents some students who really need it, the ability to connect with others who truly need support or a friend. 

Perhaps the biggest hinderance and travesty for students, especially those who are new this semester, like myself, we feel somewhat robbed of the opportunity to get involved in different organizations and clubs. I’m not fully sure of the opportunities available to me. Some students are way more in the know than others. While I have done research, it’s hard to find what peaks my interest or to even connect with someone who can point me in the right direction. I’m still waiting to hear back from financial aid to address some questions, and I opened a case two weeks ago, online. 

We aren’t able to connect with the perks and the advantages of being at Cal. We don’t have easy access like what we would have if campus was open. My creativity, passion, work ethic, ability to make an impact, etc., are all suffering greatly. There’s so many things I want to do, I just need to find someone to help point me in the right direction. 

Last but definitely not forgotten... I am a Berkeley student. I have the student email. I have a student ID number. I’m enrolled in the classes and know some professors and GSI’s. I have made a super small number of friends who are Berkeley students. I am a part of some Berkeley organizations. I used to dream about coming to Berkeley and I made it, I’m here, but I have never set foot on the campus or even seen the campus a single day in my life. I have yet to see the very school that is going to shape a huge part of who I will become, or the school I hope to equally shape and impact in my own special way, and that hurts. Stings even.

",
PE,None of the above,,,,,"It is exhausting trying to maintain a healthy work from home environment while still enrolled in challenging courses. It is frustrating paying full tuition when I receive none of the benefits of a full Berkeley education. It is saddening to see my peers struggle, knowing that some have it harder than me due to mental health, physical health or financial problems. ",
SN,First generation,undocumented!,,,,"Online learning has been above all things, emotionally taxing this semester. My schedule for synchronous classes is all on Tuesday from 10 am to 5 pm. This creates an imbalance for the remainder of the week. I have quarantined as best as possible and stay indoors which means I do not get as much physical exercise compared to when I would walk to class. One would think that being at home would mean that one has time to do everything needed, but it also means the feeling of anxiety, cabin fever, despair all culminate and affect work. One could be completely organized, which I aspire to do every week, and still feel emotional distress associated with classwork. It even affects my personal life as I do not sit at a computer to talk with my friends as much because I dedicate so much time already to classwork. Online learning has always been a route for people, especially those taking night classes and working during the day. It is much different to undergo online learning during a pandemic in which we are encouraged to be inside all the time. It is my last year at Cal and thinking that my time here will end with most likely a livestream graduation is so discouraging and disappointing, though I acknowledge it's necessary. I currently have a professor who expects the same diligence from students as if we'll work the same and that just isn't the case.","lack of exercise/outdoor time, anxiety, feeling overwhelmed, stress from work, disappointment, stress from expectation (productivity)"
HM,Transfer,Re-entry student,First generation,,,"I could rant for days about this semester, but in summary it's been: isolating, lonely, difficult conceptually, difficult to the see the point in it, and I don't feel like I'm learning. I originally wanted to go to grad school but I feel the chance of that happening is slipping away with every remote semester where my resume/research experience/grades continue to stall. ",
NS,First generation,Low-income,,,,"Online learning during Covid-19 last Spring did not impact me very much at all. This semester, Covid-19 has exacerbated a lot of issues that I've experienced. Also, professors appear to be increasing their workload with the understanding that the amount they are assigning is reasonable when in reality it is not. It is not at all considerate of the time and energy that I have to spend as a student attempting to balance extracurricular activities (including community work) and 15 units nor is it considerate of my needs as a person, I have to do laundry, shower, get my groceries... this semester I've had to constantly sacrifice my self-care for academic issues and when I reach out for support I'm really not getting it. I qualify for DSP but I can't access medical help because the system is overwhelmed. The campus has clearly failed to respond to the fact that Covid-19 has grown worse and they feel that they have responded appropriately because they have adapted technology wise through Zoom. Well the technology fund that they brag so much about never reached back to me about a hotspot. A lot of the basic needs resources and things that make Cal more equitable are not available to students who had to go back home due to high rent. Students who are experiencing a mental health crisis have to wait at least 3 weeks before seeking care. In general, the workload assigned is totally unreasonable and professors deciding not to record their lectures in a pandemic, taking them down after a while, really kills the success of students who are most vulnerable during this pandemic. Especially students who do not know how to communicate their needs or find themselves discouraged because the solutions offered after they ask for help do not help.",
DP,Receive DSP (Disabled Students' Program) accomodations,Transfer,Re-entry student,First generation,Student parent,Overall my experience has been positive with the exception of outside of the classroom I find it somewhat difficult to focus on the lecture from a computer. I like the chat feature of Zoom as I feel students are more willing to us it to express themselves. I miss the campus!,
AZ,None of the above,,,,,"Online learning frequently conflicted with unpredictable events in my area, such as a wildfire, which made it difficult for me to learn at the same pace with the rest of my class. Additionally, the pandemic not only heightened my family's existing anxieties, but also forced me to become the primary emotional and technological support for my family this semester. ",
NC,Receive DSP (Disabled Students' Program) accomodations,Transfer,First generation,Student parent,,"This semester has been really challenging trying to take classes at home and study when I have a son who is in middle school attending school online as well. My oldest son works from home some days so we are all doing our best to thrive in an environment with many distractions. Although it has been tough, we are all doing the best we can given these strange circumstances.",
GL,Receive DSP (Disabled Students' Program) accomodations,Transfer,Re-entry student,First generation,,"My experience with online learning during COVID has been eventful. I have struggled with mental health challenge, family financial crises, and the ability to focus due to heightened racial tensions; and, there have been highlights surrounding research and graduate school pursuits which have given me a reason to push forward. ",
C,Transfer,Re-entry student,First generation,,,"Sometimes I think it is great because I don’t have physically show up to classes, but my personal life stress (not being able to work to support myself, unstable housing, family illness etc) have caused me to fall seriously behind. I don’t how to talk about it because I feel like I’m the only one experiencing this ",
BR,Receive DSP (Disabled Students' Program) accomodations,,,,,"It was overall very difficult to adapt, but I am getting used to it. The hard part is trying to stay active because most of my days consists of sitting, which I don't think is healthy. But then again, doesn't the work force include a lot of sitting? ",
BT,None of the above,,,,,Online learning has been hard this semester because my professors have assigned more work and it feels like there is little structure in my life.,
RN,Receive DSP (Disabled Students' Program) accomodations,Transfer,Re-entry student,First generation,Student parent,It is really difficult.,
GD,Transfer,Re-entry student,First generation,Student parent,,Hate the on-line  learning because the human connection is lost. Technological machines will never be the replacement for what is natural between the human  interaction .,
MS,Receive DSP (Disabled Students' Program) accomodations,Transfer,Re-entry student,,,"I can't focus. I'm interacting and am able to be social over video, but I'm less able to ask for what I need, and I am less able to help my peers who are failing. I am stressed and depressed and disoriented.",
MH,Receive DSP (Disabled Students' Program) accomodations,First generation,,,,"It has been the most power-reducing experience. I thought that this semester would be the moment for professors and the university to showcase community support and empathy, but it has been the semester where being a student of color, first-generation, and low-income weigh heavier than ever before. Having a virtual environment be a window into our worlds during COVID has not only been vulnerable, it's been invasive. Without the acknowledgement of student struggle and inequities playing into a virtual environment, this time has felt so heavy. I think there is something to be said about holding the institution accountable and want to speak on this.",
HP,Transfer,young student/ transfer: 17 years old,Junior,,,"I feel like I'm missing out on the college experience. I've had a non-traditional path to get here but I was really hoping to settle into a ""normal"" educational experience finally. I don't feel like I'm getting that.",
MH,Transfer,First generation,,,,"I have a love-hate relationship with the institution right now, and I have so many thoughts about this semester now that it coming to an end. To start off, my first semester here at Cal pretty rough. Not in terms of material (although I did struggle a bit in that too) but it was rough to stay sane. To say this semester was hard is an understatement. One of the major challenges I experienced this semester was the fact that I had to endure my entire semester remotely. Staying motivated for classes was hard, and finding time to stay off the computer has become harder. To be quite honest, I have made the decision that I will be canceling my enrollment for the next semester. I simply cannot justify paying the full price to be staring at a computer screen for hours on end. My motivation has deteriorated, and I’m holding on by a thread to at least stay afloat these last week of the semester. I am also reentering the workforce because I have to regain the lost money from actually moving up to Berkeley, even though classes were completely remote. The pandemic has ruined half of my time here at Berkeley, and simply cannot do another semester of this.",
LG,None of the above,,,,,I’ve been a workaholic since covid began. My overall life quality hasn’t changed much but I’ve started working at my laptop from sunrise to 7 or 8 pm almost every day and it’s not sustainable. ,
YY,Transfer,,,,,DISASTER! I really want to take classes in real! ,
